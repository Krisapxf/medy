Machine Learning Models Project 📊🤖

This program is designed to analyze data files and perform various machine learning tasks, offering different models for regression and classification. It’s easy to use and lets you select from several powerful algorithms, all while providing a user-friendly interface. 🎉

Features 🚀
Multiple Models: Choose from Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each model is tailored for specific types of data analysis! 📈
Easy to Use: Just input your data file and select the desired model. The program will handle the rest, making machine learning simple and accessible! 🔥
Data File Handling: The program can load CSV files with ease and process them to run different algorithms. 📂
Models Included 🧠
Linear Regression: Predict continuous outcomes based on a linear relationship between variables. 📉
Logistic Regression: Perfect for classification tasks where the result is binary (e.g., spam detection). ⚖️
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model used mainly for classification, including an option for Laplace smoothing. 🔢
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple and effective classifier based on the proximity of data points, though currently under development. 📍
How to Use 📥

Run the program:
python main.py

Select the model you want to run from the menu and input your data file when prompted.
The program will execute the chosen machine learning model and display the results!
